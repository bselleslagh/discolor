## Test Development Methodology

Source: ODAT Development Page

"Because of this lack of a definitive version, the approach for test development taken was to rely on people's self-typing to select items. The basic idea being that an item is a good one for measuring that type if people who identify as that type score higher on average on that item."

"To validate items, the criteria used was that if an item is a good item, it should have a type score higher than all the others on it. To make sure the self-reported type was reliable, anyone who answered either 'Not very confident' or '0-1 hours' of experience was ignored in the analysis."

Final items: "These 16 items are used as the OSPP DISC Assessment Test 1.0."
